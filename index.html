	<!-- Bug found in Version 1.3 -->
	<div class="blogPostStart">
		<div class="blogPostLeft">
			<h1 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">Bug found in v1.3</h1>
			<h3 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">13/09/2017</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Oh boy... I found a bug in v1.3 while playing it. If you ascend while having a map selected other than Angel Island, the map's graphic will stay as the background after you ascend even though the game thinks you're on Angel Island. It's not a major bug, but it's something I'd really like to fix. I'd better fix that in an upcoming version (v1.4 confirmed?)</p>

	<!-- Version 1.3 -->
	<div class="blogPostStart">
		<div class="blogPostLeft">
			<h1 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">Version 1.3</h1>
			<h4 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">13/09/2017</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Yay! New update! It's a really big one, too...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added more pages in the shop</li>
				<li>Added more characters (like Shadow and Amy) with special abilities</li>
				<li>Added new maps</li>
				<li>Added two new story cutscenes to unlock</li>
				<li>Added a credits menu</li>
				<li>Created a proper main menu</li>
				<li>Added a cutscenes menu to watch previous cutscenes</li>
				<li>Added music for each map and for cutscenes</li>
				<li>Chuckled</li>
				<li>Added powerups and Chaos Emeralds to collect</li>
				<li>I think I fixed that crashing problem that people were having</li>
				<li>Added an 'ascension' mechanic to help you earn more rings!</li>
				<li>Added a reset option if you want to delete all of your data</li>
				<li>Added two new bosses</li>
				<li>Added a new Sonic font that I use in some places</li>
				<li>This is a big update, so I created an 'update' screen when you first load up the game to install updates. It should take around 2-3 minutes to download, but for your amusement during this time, you can tap on Knuckles to make him say his famous 'Oh no'. Don't worry; this screen won't show up again unless you update the game in the future or reinstall the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Phew! That updating screen thing was really tiring. I've never done anything like that before, so you guys better be happy about it! It's a little unstable because it might need to redownload the file once or twice. I'll fix that eventually, but for now, just leave the game alone until it's finished and it should all be OK.</p>
			<p>I'm really starting to get into making Flappy Knuckles, tbh. It started off as a dumb joke I made in an afternoon but after adding lots of story and characters and effort into it, I feel like I should probably finish it.</p>
			<p>That is, if this game gets enough attention. Right now, I'm really chuffed to see so many people play it, review it and do videos of it. The more that happens, the more I'm motivated to make more. You guys want more, right?</p>
			<p>I'm really starting to put a lot of Sonic assets into it, so I hope SEGA doesn't kick my ass about it. Hopefully they won't. It's not like they're Nintendo or anything. As a matter of fact, I might even be prosecuted by stating their name.</p>
