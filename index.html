		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Hey guys, bad news.</p>
			<p>Flappy Knuckles has been taken down from Google Play, this time by SEGA themselves. The reason is copyright infringement, which I can't argue against seeing as though it's a fan-game, so I have no other choice other than to just put the APK up for download and pray people know how to install APK files to their phones...</p>
			<p>You can find the APK on the releases page <a href="https://github.com/Taking1n1/FlappyKnuckles/releases">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Also, to reflect this, the links above have been changed.</p>
			<p>P.S: This doesn't mean that Flappy Knuckles 2 is cancelled, I still want to see that game finished!</p>

		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>It's back up!</p>
			<p>It's gone back to 0 downloads, but at least it's on the Play Store again. Your save data will go back to square one as well. Sorry about that, there's not much I can do there. This is the best I can do, outside of uploading the APK and hoping that people know how to install an APK file.</p>

			<p>Hey guys, some bad news.</p>
			<p>Google recently took down Flappy Knuckles from the Play Store on the grounds that it violates their "spam" policy, even though the game has nothing to do with spam and doesn't violate any of their spam policies (I've checked).</p>
			<p>I'm doing my best to get it back up, but if worst comes to the worst, I'll still have the PC version and I'll just have to upload an APK for the Android version and expect people to install it from that (which is tricky for younger players, as they probably won't know how to do it).</p>
			<p>So, for now, it's not going to be up on the Play Store. I can't say for sure that it'll come back up, but it's a possibility and I really hope it gets unsuspended.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, the PC version is still up on the GitHub and the itch.io page, so there's that. If the Play Store version doesn't get put back up, I'll upload the APK and put a link to that here. Sorry for the inconvenience, and stay hyped for Flappy Knuckles 2!</p>

		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>v1.4.1 is here!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed crashing when Silver hits the floor before his telekinesis has finished</li>
				<li>Fixed crashing when your ring count gets too big</li>
				<li>Changed boss 4 so that it's no longer RNG-based</li>
				<li>E-102 is broken. Really broken.</li>
				<li>Added an atlas map for the shop for its textures, so it might lag less</li>
				<li>On the final phase of the final boss, E-102 will now stay in place after an attack</li>
				<li>Removed MobiBurn library, to avoid trouble with GDPR and generally because I wasn't earning much out of it</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not much; this mainly removed MobiBurn.</p>
			<p>The fourth boss is also nerfed so that it's more fair.</p>

			<p>Doesn't that excite you? I wonder what the game will be like...</p>
			<p>I'm going to have the summer off, so I'll have plenty of time to work on this. I'm making it in Unity, so hopefully it'll be more robust than Flappy Knuckles 1.</p>

			<h3 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">15/09/2017</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Wow, three consecutive updates in less than a week? Hopefully this will be the last bug fix one.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Compressed files to save space and increase download time, so cutscenes might look a bit JPEG-y.</li>
				<li>Changed the host of the update file, so if you do encounter the update screen (which you probably won't) it'll now download really fast and won't just completely fail.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>More bug fixes. Yeah, nothing interesting. Don't worry; come v1.4, there will be more characters, maps and story!</p>
			<p>Oh, and by the way, this update is Android only. These updates only apply to the Android version of the game, so there's no point of updating it to PC because there would be no change. Don't feel insulted, PC gamers! This just means that you're easier to maintain and manage.</p>

		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Jeez, this was a rush. I realised the expansion pack wasn't uploaded and that I should've put the expansion pack with the APK when you download it. So this time around, I did. I also did a few bug fixes!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug in which you ascend and the background graphic remains the same and does not revert to Angel Island</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug that would continue to play the boss music when you die before reaching the boss but after reaching the ring threshold.</li>
				<li>I'm adding the expansion file with the APK when I release this version, so that the updates are installed when you download this update. Hopefully that'll reduce the amount of problems with the updating screen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, yeah. Nothing new. Just bug fixes, and one really big bug fix.</p>
			<p>I apologise if you tried to download the update and it failed; that was on my part. This update should take care of that!</p>

		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Oh boy... I found a bug in v1.3 while playing it. If you ascend while having a map selected other than Angel Island, the map's graphic will stay as the background after you ascend even though the game thinks you're on Angel Island. It's not a major bug, but it's something I'd really like to fix. I'd better fix that in an upcoming version (v1.4 confirmed?)</p>

		</div>
		<div class="blogPostRight">
			<p>Yay! New update! It's a really big one, too...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added more pages in the shop</li>
				<li>Added more characters (like Shadow and Amy) with special abilities</li>
				<li>Added new maps</li>
				<li>Added two new story cutscenes to unlock</li>
				<li>Added a credits menu</li>
				<li>Created a proper main menu</li>
				<li>Added a cutscenes menu to watch previous cutscenes</li>
				<li>Added music for each map and for cutscenes</li>
				<li>Chuckled</li>
				<li>Added powerups and Chaos Emeralds to collect</li>
				<li>I think I fixed that crashing problem that people were having</li>
				<li>Added an 'ascension' mechanic to help you earn more rings!</li>
				<li>Added a reset option if you want to delete all of your data</li>
				<li>Added two new bosses</li>
				<li>Added a new Sonic font that I use in some places</li>
				<li>This is a big update, so I created an 'update' screen when you first load up the game to install updates. It should take around 2-3 minutes to download, but for your amusement during this time, you can tap on Knuckles to make him say his famous 'Oh no'. Don't worry; this screen won't show up again unless you update the game in the future or reinstall the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Phew! That updating screen thing was really tiring. I've never done anything like that before, so you guys better be happy about it! It's a little unstable because it might need to redownload the file once or twice. I'll fix that eventually, but for now, just leave the game alone until it's finished and it should all be OK.</p>
			<p>I'm really starting to get into making Flappy Knuckles, tbh. It started off as a dumb joke I made in an afternoon but after adding lots of story and characters and effort into it, I feel like I should probably finish it.</p>
			<p>That is, if this game gets enough attention. Right now, I'm really chuffed to see so many people play it, review it and do videos of it. The more that happens, the more I'm motivated to make more. You guys want more, right?</p>
			<p>I'm really starting to put a lot of Sonic assets into it, so I hope SEGA doesn't kick my ass about it. Hopefully they won't. It's not like they're Nintendo or anything. As a matter of fact, I might even be prosecuted by stating their name.</p>
